1.2.0 (unreleased)
------------------

This release doesn't have any new user-facing feature but packs a bunch of fixes
and improvements, both in the code but also the documentation and examples.

Also worth noting, is the full continuous integration pipeline that has been
setup behind the scenes. It will hopefully make it a lot easier to work on the
project.
